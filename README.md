# Uber Data Analysis 

This Uber data analysis project uses Python to explore ride information and answer key questions about user behavior. The analysis includes finding out how long trips last, which hours and days are most popular for rides, the common trip purposes, the number of trips per day and month, and identifying frequent starting points for journeys. These insights help understand ride patterns and peak times for Uber usage.
